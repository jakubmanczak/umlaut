# umlaut

This is a simple script for inserting german umlaut characters (+ß) when holding left alt.

Created to counter the need of using a different keyboard layout.

Left Alt was chosen in contrast to the right Alt, as the latter is used to insert polish characters in the polish keyboard layout.

Accounts for pressing Shift and inverting it while Caps Lock is pressed.

Once ran, hides in system tray and converts these keystrokes to umlaut characters until turned off:

# keys

LALT + A = ä

LALT + O = ö

LALT + U = ü

LALT + S = ß

LALT + SHIFT + A = Ä

LALT + SHIFT + O = Ö

LALT + SHIFT + U = Ü

LALT + SHIFT + S = ẞ

Inverted while Caps Lock is pressed.
