# umlaut

This is a simple script for inserting german umlaut characters (+ß) when holding left alt.

Created to counter the need of using a different keyboard layout.

Left Alt was chosen in contrast to the right Alt, as the latter is used to insert polish characters in the polish keyboard layout.
